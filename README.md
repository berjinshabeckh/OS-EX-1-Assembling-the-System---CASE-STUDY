# Ex-1 ASSEMBLING THE SYSTEM

# AIM:
To assemble the computer system.

# MATERIALS REQUIRED:
   - Central Processing Unit (CPU)
   - Motherboard
   - Memory (RAM)
   - Storage (Hard Drive or SSD)
   - Power Supply Unit (PSU)
   - Graphics Card (if not using integrated graphics)
   - Optical Drive (optional)
   - Computer Case
   - Input Devices (keyboard, mouse)
   - Monitor
   - Cables (SATA, power, data, etc.)

# PROCEDURE:
1.Prepare Your Workspace:
   - Find a clean, well-lit area with sufficient space to work comfortably.
   - Use an anti-static wristband to ground yourself, or touch a grounded metal object frequently to discharge any static electricity to avoid damaging sensitive components.
2.Install the processor (CPU):
   - Open the CPU socket on the motherboard.
   - Carefully insert the CPU, aligning the notches or markers.
   - Apply thermal paste if necessary (some CPU coolers come with pre-applied paste).
   - Attach the CPU cooler following the manufacturer's instructions.

3.Install RAM:
   - Open the RAM slots on the motherboard.
   - Align the notch on the RAM stick with the slot and gently push it in until it clicks into place.

5.Install Storage:
   - Mount your hard drive or SSD in a drive bay in the case.
   - Connect SATA and power cables to the storage device and motherboard.

6.Install Power Supply Unit (PSU):
   - Secure the PSU in the case according to the case and PSU instructions.
   - Connect power cables to the motherboard, CPU, and storage devices.

7.Install Graphics Card (if applicable):
   - Insert the graphics card into the appropriate PCIe slot on the motherboard.
   - Secure it to the case (if necessary) and connect PCIe power cables.

8.Connect Cables:
   - Connect all necessary cables, including data and power cables for drives, front panel connectors (power button, LEDs, etc.), and any other peripherals

9.Organize Cables:
    - Tidy up the cables to ensure good airflow and aesthetics.

10.Install Operating System:
    - Boot the system and install your chosen operating system from a bootable USB drive or DVD.

11.Install Drivers:
    - Install drivers for your motherboard, GPU, and other components. Download the latest drivers from the manufacturers' websites.

12.Update BIOS/UEFI (if necessary):
    - Check if there are BIOS/UEFI updates for your motherboard and follow the manufacturer's instructions to update if needed.

13.Test and Troubleshoot:
    - Boot the system and ensure all components are working correctly.
    - If you encounter issues, consult your component manuals or seek online support forums for assistance.

14.Install Software and Configure:
    - Install your desired software and configure the operating system to your liking.

15.Backup and Maintenance:
    - Regularly back up your data and perform routine maintenance to keep your system running smoothly.
    
# RESULT:
The computer system is successfully installed.
